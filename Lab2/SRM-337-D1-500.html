<h3>Topcoder SRM 337, D1, 500-point problem</h3>

If Topcoder isn't working, you may read the problem description
at <a href=http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=7473&rd=10661>http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=7473&rd=10661</a>.
<p>
To compile this one, solve the problem as you would on Topcoder
in the file
<b>BuildingAdvertise.cpp</b>.  Then compile by calling <b>g++</b>
on <b><a href=SRM-337-Driver.cpp>SRM-337-Driver.cpp</a></b>.
You give the example number on the command line.  If you give an argument
of -1, you enter <b>h</b> and <b>n</b> on standard input:
<p>
<pre>

</pre>

To solve this problem, you'd like to be able to do something like the following.
First, you create <b>R</b> using pretty much the exact code from the problem 
specification.   To make your life easier, put a zero in front of <b>R</b>
and at the end.  Then, you do something like:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  rv = 0;
  for (i = 1; i &lt; R.size()-1; i++) {
    l = index of the first building to my left whose height is &lt; R[i];
    r = index of the first building to my right whose height is &lt; R[i];
    area = R[i] * (r-l-1)
    if (area &gt; rv) rv = area;
  }
  return rv;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, you can find <b>l</b> and <b>r</b> with <b>for</b> loops starting from <b>i</b>.
Unfortunately, though, that is too slow.  If you try such an approach on example 2,
where <b>n</b> is 100000, it runs too slowly.  This is because your <b>for</b> 
loops are each potentially <i>O(n)</i>, which means that the running time of your
program can be <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>.  That's too slow.
<p>
Instead, try a different approach.  Suppose you visit the buildings from lowest to 
highest.  Whenever you visit a building, you insert it into a set, which we will
call <b>X</b>.  Let's use example 0 to help us motivate why this works.  With 
example 0, you have the following buildings:

<UL>
<LI> Building 1 has a height of 3.
<LI> Building 2 has a height of 6.
<LI> Building 3 has a height of 5.
<LI> Building 4 has a height of 6.
<LI> Building 5 has a height of 2.
<LI> Building 6 has a height of 4.
</UL>
We are going to add two sentinels:  Buildings 0 and 7 have heights of zero.  Here is 
an ASCII-art drawing of the buildings:

<p><center><table border=3><td>
<pre>
  X X  
  XXX  
  XXX X
 XXXX X
 XXXXXX
 XXXXXX
01234567
</pre>
</td></table></center><p>

Now, we are going to process the buildings in increasing order of height.  That 
means that we'll process them in the order (0, 7, 5, 1, 6, 3, 2, 4).  After we
process a building, we are going to add it to a set <b>X</b>.  
<p>
So, let's suppose
that we are processing building 5.  The two buildings in the set are 0 and 7,
and we know that their heights are less than or equal to building 5's height.
All of the buildings which aren't in the set have heights greater than or equal
to building 5's height.
<p>
What we're going to do is look for the two buildings that are on either side of 
building 5 in <b>X</b>.  These will be buildings 0 and 7.  We know that the buildings
from 1 to 6 are at least as tall as building 5, which defines a rectangle whose base
is 6 and whose height is 2.  Therefore, its area is 12.  We add building 5 to
the set. 
<p>
Now, we process building 1.  The buildings on either side of it in <b>X</b> are
buildings 0 and 5.  That means that the buildings from 1 to 4 are at least as
tall as building 3, which defines a rectangle whose area is also 12.  
<p>
I'm hoping that you see how this works.  I'm going to formalize the process as 
follows:
<p>
Create a multimap that stores building heights
in its keys, and indices in <b>R</b> in its vals.  Include
the two sentinels at the beginning and at the end of <b>R</b>.  
Create a set <b>X</b> whose elements are integers.
Then, for each successive element of the map you do the following:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Let <b>H</b> be the height and <b>I</b> be the index of the element.
<LI> If the element is one of the sentinels, store <b>I</b> in <b>X</b>.
<LI> Otherwise, look up the element in <b>X</b> whose value is the smallest
greater than <b>I</b>.  That will equal <b>r</b> in the <b>for</b> loop above.
Look up the previous element to <b>r</b> in <b>X</b>.  That will equal <b>l</b>.
Now you can calculate the area of the element with index <b>I</b>.  
<LI> Finally, if you haven't done so already, store <b>I</b> in the set.
</UL>

This isn't exactly equivalent to the for loop above.  It looks at the elements in
a different order, and it also treats elements with equal values of <b>H</b> 
differently.  But it will work correctly.  Working through an example should help
convince you.  Let's take example 0 to illustrate.
<p>
Your multimap will contain the following elements:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
(0,0) (0,7) (2,5) (3,1) (4,6) (5,3) (6,2) (6,4)
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we iterate through the map, here's what happens to <b>X</b>, <b>area</b> and <b>rv</b>:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><b>H</b></td>
    <td><b>I</b></td>
    <td><b>X</b> before</td>
    <td><b>l</b></td>
    <td><b>r</b></td>
    <td><b>area</b></td>
    <td><b>rv</b></td>
    <td><b>X</b> after</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>{ } </td>
    <td><i>na</i></td>
    <td><i>na</i></td>
    <td><i>na</i></td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>{ 0 } </td></tr>

    <td>7</td>
    <td>{ 0 } </td>
    <td><i>na</i></td>
    <td><i>na</i></td>
    <td><i>na</i></td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>{ 0, 7 } </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>{ 0, 7 } </td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>{ 0, 5, 7 } </td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>{ 0, 5, 7 } </td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 5, 7 } </td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 5, 7 } </td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 5, 6, 7 } </td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 5, 6, 7 } </td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 } </td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 } </td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 } </td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 } </td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 } </td></tr>
</table></center><p>

And we return <b>15</b>.
<hr>
The running time of this will be <i>O(n </i>log<sub>2</sub><i> n)</i>.
<p>
Hack it up.  Remember to use <b>upper_bound</b>.

<h3>A Little More Help</h3>

(Tue Aug 30 16:08:25 EDT 2016): 
If you call <b>a.out-337</b> with an argument of -2, then my executable will print the
towers and their heights, and then it will print the multimap, which has the same information,
but in a different order.  Then, it prints out the processing of each building.
You don't have to implement this.  I have just done so to help you.
<p>
For example, here it is running on the first gradescript:
